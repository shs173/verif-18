Please type "source ./setup.scr" at the command prompt first to setup your
work environment.

All your Verilog source needs to be compiled using vl2mv first.  For example,
compile adder64bit.v by typing "vl2mv adder64bit.v" at the command prompt. This
will produce the file adder64bit.mv if your source Verilog is free of errors.

Invoke Vis by typing "vis" at the command prompt, and follow the three command
sequence shown below to establish equivalence/inequivalence between
adder64bit.mv and adder64bitmodular.mv

vis> read_blif_mv adder64bit.mv
Warning: Some variables are unused in model adder64.
vis> init_verify
vis> comb_verify adder64bitmodular.mv
Networks are combinationally equivalent.

vis> quit

The carry lookahead (CLA) adder that you need to design using non-behavioral
primitives is adder64bitCLA.v -- the shell file is provided and there are few
comments in the file to get you started.
