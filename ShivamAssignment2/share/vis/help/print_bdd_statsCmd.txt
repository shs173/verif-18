   the functions of the network are themselves represented by BDDs via an
   encoding of the multi-valued variables into binary valued variables. The
   statistics given by this command depend on the underlying BDD package with
   which VIS was linked. To get more information about the statistics, consult
   the documentation for the given BDD package. The commands flatten_hierarchy
   and static_order must be invoked before this command.

   Command options:
