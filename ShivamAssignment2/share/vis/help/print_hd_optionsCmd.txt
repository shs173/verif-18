   print_hd_options [-h]

   Prints  information  about the current HD options. The HD method is an
   alternate  method to compute a least fixpoint and is provided with the
   compute_reach and check_invariant commands. The method is described in Ravi
   and Somenzi, ICCAD95. The command can be used only when compiled with the
   CUDD package.

   Command options:

   -h
   Print the command usage.

   Set parameters: The HD options are specified with the set command.

   hd_frontier_approx_method <method>
          This option specifes the method to approximate the frontier set.

          Methods:

          remap_ua : (Default) The BDD approximation method of DAC98 Ravi,
          Shiple, McMillan, Somenzi.

          biased_rua : Approximation method similar to remap_ua, but uses a
          bias function. The bias function is set appropriate to the context.

          under_approx : The BDD approximation method of Shiple's thesis.

          heavy_branch : The BDD approximation method of ICCAD95 Ravi, Somenzi.

          short_paths : The BDD approximation method of ICCAD95 Ravi, Somenzi.

          compress : An approximation method that runs short_paths first and
          then remap_ua.

   hd_frontier_approx_threshold <number>
          This option specifes the size of the frontier to be used for image
          computation. The threshold for the various methods is approximate
          (not strictly adhered to). For the remap_ua and biased_rua method,
          this threshold is a lower bound and the default is 3500. For the
          short_paths and heavy_branch methods, this threshold is an upper
          bound. Therefore, a default of 2000 is set to obtain a meaningful
          result. Any value lower than 2000 is corrected to this default. This
          value is also relevant for dead-end computations. In a dead-end, the
          threshold for each image computation (of a disjunct of Reached) is
          five times the frontier approximation threshold. When the frontier
          approximation threshold is 0, the threshold for each dead-end image
          computation is 5000.

   hd_approx_quality <double>
          This option specifies the quality factor for the under_approx and
          remap_ua methods. Default value is 1.0. The range is any double value
          greater than 0. Smaller quality factors produce smaller results.
          Meaningful values are between 1 and 2.

   hd_approx_bias_quality <double>
          This option specifies the quality factor for the biased_rua method.
          Default value is 0.5. The range is any double value greater than 0.
          Smaller quality factors produce smaller results. Meaningful values
          are between 0 and 1.

   hd_dead_end <method>
          This option specifies the method used for dead-end computation. A
          "dead-end"  is  characterized  by an empty frontier. A dead-end
          computation involves generating new states from the reached set.

          Methods:

          brute_force : Computes the image of the entire reached set. May be
          fatal if the reached set is very large.

          conjuncts : (Default) Computes the image of reached by decomposing
          into parts.

          hybrid : Computes the image of a subset of reached. If no new states,
          then the reaminder is decomposed in parts.

   hd_dead_end_approx_method <method>
          This option allows the specification of the approximation method to
          use to compute the subset of Reached at the dead-end. The threshold
          used is the same as hd_frontier_approx_threshold.

          For methods, refer hd_frontier_approx_method methods. Default is
          remap_ua.

   hd_no_scrap_states
          This allows the option of not adding the "scrap" states. Scrap states
          are residues from the approximation of the frontier set. Default is
          to add the scrap states.

   hd_new_only
          This allows the option of adding considering only new states of each
          iteration for image computation. The default is to take a set in the
          interval of the new states and the reached set.

   hd_only_partial_image
          This allows the option of HD with partial image computation only (no
          approximation of the frontier set). Default is to allow both partial
          images and approximation of the frontier set.

   Partial Image options:

   hd_partial_image_method <method>
          This option allows the image computation to approximate the image
          with the specified method.

          Methods:

          approx : (Default) Computes a partial image by under-approximating
          the intermediate products of image computation.

          clipping  : Computes a partial image by "clipping" the depth of
          recursion of the and-abstract computations during image computation.

   hd_partial_image_threshold <number>
          This options allows the specification of a threshold (in terms of bdd
          node  size  of  the  intermediate  product)  that  will trigger
          approximation of the intermediate product. Default is 200000. This
          option has to be used in conjunction with hd_partial_image_size. If
          the value of hd_partial_image_size is larger than this option, then
          the approximation of the intermediate size will be as large as the
          hd_partial_image_size number.

   hd_partial_image_size <number>
          This options allows the specification of a size (in terms of bdd node
          size of the intermediate product) that is the target size of the
          approximated  intermediate  product. Default is 100000. For the
          short_paths and heavy_branch methods, the size of the approximation
          is corrected to 10000 if the size specified is lower. This is because
          the short_paths and heavy_branch methods consider this size as an
          upper bound on the approximation. This option has to be used in
          conjunction  with  hd_partial_image_threshold.  If the value of
          hd_partial_image_threshold is much larger than this option, then the
          desired  size  will not be obtained as approximation may not be
          triggered.

   hd_partial_image_approx <method>
          This options allows the specification of the method to be used to
          approximate the intermediate product.

          For methods, refer hd_frontier_approx_method methods. Default is
          remap_ua.

   hd_partial_image_approx_quality <double>
          This option specifies the quality factor for the under_approx and
          remap_ua methods for partial image computation. Default value is 1.0.
          Range of values is any double greater than 0. Smaller quality factors
          produce smaller results. Meaningful values are between 1 and 2.

   hd_partial_image_approx_bias_quality <double>
          This option specifies the quality factor for the biased_rua method
          for partial image computation. Default value is 0.5. Range of values
          is any double greater than 0. Smaller quality factors produce smaller
          results. Meaningful values are between 0 and 1.

   hd_partial_image_clipping_depth <double>
          This  option allows the specification of the depth at which the
          recursion can be clipped when _hd_partial_image_method_ is clipping.
          Range  of values is between 0 and 1. The clipping depth is then
          calculated as the specified fraction of the number of variables.
          Default is 0.4.
