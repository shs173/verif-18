  decompose_child - Partitions Node components into child nodes.
     _________________________________________________________________

   decompose_child  -n  <groupname>  [-f  <filename>] [-c] [-v] [-t] [-l]
   [<components>]

   This command partitions the current Node into several new children nodes
   according to user-specified groups. The user may specify several groups by
   name [-n] sequentially on the command line. Within each group a list of
   components (either variables or child nodes) can be placed. The flags [-c]
   [-v] toggle whether element names are interpreted as child instances or
   variables (default is instances [-c]). Element names can be loaded from a
   file as well using the [-f] flag.

   By specifying a variable to be grouped, any object (e.g., Table, Latch,
   Child) that PRODUCES that variable is included in the newly created child
   node for that group.

   Command options:

   -n <groupname>
          Define new group

   -f <filename>
          Load names from file

   -c
          Interpret names that follow as child instances to group

   -v
   Interpret names that follow as variables

   -l
   Include all latch output nodes (and therefore latches) in group

   -t
   Include all combinational tables in group. Examples:

   decompose_child -n c1 -v G1 G2 -n c2 IA IB

   Place variables G1 and G2 into a new child node c1 and child nodes IA and IB
   into a new child node c2.

   Example:

   decompose_child -n ckt_inst child1 -f myinstances -v var1 -n latch_inst -l

   This groups the subckts child1 and those listed in the file myinstances, as
   well as the variable var1 into a subckt called 'ckt_inst'. It also groups
   all the latches into a subckt called 'latch_inst'.
