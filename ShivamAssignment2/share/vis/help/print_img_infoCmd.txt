  print_img_info - print information about the image method currently in use
     _________________________________________________________________

   print_img_info [-b] [-f] [-h]

   Prints information about the image computation method currently being used
   by the FSM. This includes the particular values of parameters used by the
   method for initialization. If the image information does not exist, then
   this command forces the information to be computed. If none of the flags (-b
   or -f) is set, forward transition relation is computed.

   Command options:

   -b
          Compute the transition relation for backward image computation (if
          needed).

   -f
          Compute the transition relation for forward image computation (if
          needed).

   -h
          Print the command usage.
