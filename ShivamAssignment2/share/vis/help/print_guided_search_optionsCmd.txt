   print_guided_search_options [-h]

   Prints information about current Guided Search options. Guided search is an
   alternate method to compute fixpoints by modifying the fixpoint computation
   with restrictions. It is applicable to the compute_reach, check_invariant
   and model_check commands (refer to their help pages on the use of guided
   search).  See  also for details: Ravi and Somenzi, Hints to accelerate
   symbolic traversal. CHARME'99; Bloem, Ravi, and Somenzi, Efficient Decision
   Procedures for Model Checking of Linear Time Logic Properties, CAV'99;
   Bloem, Ravi, and Somenzi, Symbolic Guided Search for CTL Model Checking,
   DAC'00. Not allowed with -A 2 or -i, and will only work with iwls95 or
   monolithic image methods. The description of some options can be found in
   the help page for set.

   Command options:

   guided_search_hint_type
          Choose from local (default) or global. If this flag is set to local,
          then every subformula is evaluated to completion, using all hints in
          order, before the next subformula is started. For pure ACTL or pure
          ECTL formulae, we can also set guided_search_hint_type to global, in
          which case the entire formula is evaluated for one hint before moving
          on to the next hint, using underapproximations.

   guided_search_underapprox_minimize_method
          Choose from "constrain" and "and" (default). Sets the method with
          which the transition relation is minimized when underapproximations
          are used. The option constrain is incompatible with hints that use
          signals other than inputs.

   guided_search_overapprox_minimize_method
          Choose from "squeeze" and "ornot" (default). Sets the method with
          which the transition relation is minimized when underapproximations
          are used. The option squeeze is incompatible with hints that use
          signals other than inputs. Ornot implies that the transition relation
          will be disjoined with the negation of the hint: T' = T + ~h, whereas
          squeeze will find a small BDD between T and T'.

   guided_search_sequence
          For compute_reach and check_invariant only. Set this flag to a list
          of comma-separated integers i1,i2,...,in, with n at most the number
          of  hints  that you specify . The k'th hint will be used for ik
          iterations (images). A value of 0 causes the hint to be applied to
          convergence. Not setting this option is like setting it to 0,0,...,0.
          If length of the specified sequence is less than the number of hints,
          the sequence is padded with zeroes.

   Guided search also uses the High Density traversal options that are germane
   to dead-ends. The relevant flags are hd_dead_end, hd_dead_end_approx_method,
   hd_frontier_approx_threshold,hd_approx_quality,hd_approx_bias_quality.Use
   help on the print_hd_options command for explanation of these flags. If
   guided search is used with HD using the -A 1 options in compute_reach and
   check_invariant, the HD options are used by both HD and guided search.
