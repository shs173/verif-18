  read_fairness - read a fairness constraint
     _________________________________________________________________

   read_fairness [-h] <file>

   Read a fairness constraint, and associate this constraint with the FSM of
   the flattened network. An existing constraint associated with the FSM is
   lost. Subsequent verification procedures are performed relative to the new
   constraint. Note that, by default, the flattened network has the constraint
   TRUE, indicating that all paths are fair. The command build_partition_mdds
   (or init_verify) must have already been invoked on the flattened network,
   before this command is called.

   Currently, only Buchi constraints are supported. A Buchi fairness constraint
   is given by a list of individual Buchi conditions, B1, B2, ..., Bk, where Bi
   is a set of FSM states. A state is fair if there exists an infinite path
   from that state that intersects each Bi infinitely often.

   The conditions are specified by a file containing at least one CTL formula
   (see the [1]VIS CTL and LTL syntax manual). In particular, Bi is defined by
   a CTL formula, which represents the set of states that makes the formula
   true (in the absence of any fairness constraint). References to signal names
   in the network should be made using the full hierarchical names. Note that
   the support of any wire referred to in a formula should consist only of
   latches. Each CTL formula is terminated by a semicolon.

   Example: In the three conditions below, B1 contains those states that have a
   next state where cntr.out is RED, B2 contains those where timer.active is 1,
   and  B3  contains those states for which every path from the state has
   tlc.request=1 until tlc.acknowledge=1.

  EX(cntr.out=RED);
  (timer.active=1);
  A(tlc.request=1 U tlc.acknowledge=1);
