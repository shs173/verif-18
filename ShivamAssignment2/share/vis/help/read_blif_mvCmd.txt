  read_blif_mv - read a blif-mv file
     _________________________________________________________________

   read_blif_mv [-c] [-h] [-r] [-v] <file_name>

   Reads a blif-mv file into VIS. The existing hierarchy for the blif-mv file
   previously read in is overwritten upon a successful read. If an error is
   detected while reading a file, the previous hierarchy is preserved.

   Command options:

   -c
          Semi-canonicalize all the tables in each model. The canonicalization
          process, assigns a linear order to the table rows and columns, based
          on  the  value of their entries. For a table with binary valued
          entries,  this value is exactly the number of 1's in the row or
          column. Once this linear order is assigned, the rows and columns of
          the table are swapped so as to order rows and columns with higher
          value at the beginning of the corresponding row or column order. It
          is called semi-canonicalization because two tables representing the
          same logic function need not have the same canonical form.

   -h
          Print the command usage.

   -r
          If set, the program replaces the subhierarchy rooted at the current
          node with a new hierarchy specified by a blif-mv file. The file to be
          read in has to be compatible with the i/o interface of the current
          hnode (the same i/o names with the same domains). Otherwise, the
          current hierarchy is kept intact. If -r is not specified, the entire
          hierarchy is replaced, not just the subhierarchy at the current node.

   -v
          If  set, the program prints out all the unused variables in the
          blif-mv  file.  Otherwise,  only a warning is printed that some
          variables are not used.

   <file_name>
          blif-mv file to be read in.
