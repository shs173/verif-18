  write_order - write the current order of the MDD variables of the flattened
  network
     _________________________________________________________________

   write_order [-h] [-o <type>] [<file>]

   Write the current order of the MDD variables of the flattened network. If no
   file name is specified, the output is written to stdout. A sample output is
   shown here.
  # name                 type            mddId vals levs
  system.choosing0      primary-input       31    2 (61)
  system.p0.pc          latch               32   11 (62, 63, 64, 65)
  

   The first column gives the full hierarchical path name of the node, starting
   from the current hierarchical node. The second column gives the type of the
   node in the flattened network (see the command print_network). The third
   column gives the MDD id of the node; this can be thought of as just another
   name for the node. The fourth column gives the number of values that the
   multi-valued variable at the output of the node can assume. The last column
   gives the levels of the BDD variables that encode the multi-valued variable
   (0 is the topmost level of the BDD).

   The bits of a multi-valued variable need not appear consecutively (due to
   dynamic variable ordering). Each node appears at most once in the output
   file. The nodes in the file appear in ascending order of the lowest level
   bit in the encoding of the node's multi-valued variable (e.g. a node with
   levels (12, 73) will appear before a node with levels (17, 21, 25)).

   To specify a variable ordering for static_order, a convenient tactic is to
   write out the current ordering, edit the file to rearrange the ordering (or
   comment out some nodes, using "#"), and then read the file back in using
   static_order. Note that everything after the first column is ignored when
   the file is read in.

   Command options:

   -h
          Print the command usage.

   -o <type>
          Specify  the network nodes to write out. Type can be one of the
          following:

          all: Write out all the nodes of the network. This option is allowed
          only if all variables have been ordered.

          input_and_latch: (default) Write out the primary inputs, pseudo
          inputs, latches, and next state variables.

          next_state_node: Write out the next state variables (node type is
          "shadow"). This file can be modified and read back in using the
          static_order -s next_state_node command.

   <file>
          File to which to write the ordering. By default, the ordering is
          written to stdout.
