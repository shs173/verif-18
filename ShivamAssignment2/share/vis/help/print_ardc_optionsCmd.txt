   The default settings correspond to the fast variants of LMBM and MBM. MBM
   never  produces  a  more accurate approximation than LMBM for the same
   state-space decomposition. However, the corresponding statement does not
   hold for the fast versions. (That is, FastMBM will occasionally outperform
   FastLMBM.) To get the slower, but more accurate versions of LMBM and MBM use
   the following settings:
     * set ardc_constrain_method 1
     * set ardc_constrain_reorder no
     * set ardc_abstract_pseudo_input 0
