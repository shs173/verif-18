  set_bdd_parameters - Creates a table with the value of all the flags
  currently active in VIS and calls the function bdd_set_parameters with the
  manager of the current place in the hierarchy and the table.
     _________________________________________________________________

   set_bdd_parameters [-h][-s]

   The command obtains the bdd manager of the current point in the hierarchy.
   Given  this  manager  and the set of pairs (variable,value) of the VIS
   environment, the function sets specific BDD parameters to the given values.
   This command works in conjunction with print_bdd_stats.

   Print_bdd_stats first prints a report of the parameters and statistics of
   the current bdd_manager. By using the command "set", the user may modify the
   value of any of the parameters of the underlying bdd package. The way to do
   it is by setting a value in the variable BDD.parameter name where parameter
   name is the name of the parameter exactly as printed by the print_bdd_stats
   command. In order to "re-program" the underlying bdd package this command
   must be invoked.

   Command options:

   -h
          Print the command usage.

   -s
          Print the bdd parameter and statistics after the modification.
