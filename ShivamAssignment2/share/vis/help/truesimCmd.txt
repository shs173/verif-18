  truesim - Simulate the flattened network
     _________________________________________________________________

   truesim [ -D <filename> ] [ -d ] [ -f <filename> ] [ -g <filename> ] [ -h ]
   [ -n <N> ] [ -p <filename> ] [ -r <N> ] [ -t <time> ] [ -v <N> ]

   Simulates  a  network with a set of input vectors. Before calling this
   command,  the  user  should  create  a  partition  (using  the command
   build_partition_mdds). The simulation vectors can be provided by the user
   (using -f vectors_file), or generated randomly.

   Command options:

   -D <filename>
          File to dump randomly generated vectors. Primary input probability
          file SHOULD be specified with -p option.

   -d
          Perform event-driven true delay simulation. The fanout count of the
          nodes is used as an estimate for the node delay. Primary inputs are
          assumed to have arrival times of zero.

   -f <filename>
          File containing simulation vectors. The format is simple but strict
          and hence, few checks are made. The file format is as below:

          .i c n d o e p f q g r h s i t j u k a l b m
          .s
          0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 ;
          0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ;
          0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ;
          0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 ;
          The .i statement specifies the primary inputs of the network. The
          patterns start after .s key word. Each vector is a space separated
          list of bits and ends in a semi-colon. The length of any vector
          should  be  equal  to the number of signals specified in the .i
          statement. A line starting with # is a comment.

   -g <filename>
          File to output random probabilities for primary inputs. Use this
          option ONLY to produce a vector of signal probabilities for primary
          inputs. This option does not proceed with simulation.

   -h
          Print a help message that details all options.

   -n <N>
          Number of patterns to simulate. The default is 1000. Use this option
          ONLY with -p option.

   -p <filename>
          File containing primary input probabilities. The format is as shown
          below:

          PI_Name1 0.67
          PI_Name2 0.45

   -r <N>
          Print  PI/PO names after every N patterns simulated, for better
          readability of simulation output. This option is effective only when
          the verbosity flag is on.

   -T <filename>
          File containing node delay and load values. The file format is as
          shown below:

          node1 delay1 load1
          node2 delay2 load2
          The delay vaues are assumed as specified in a common unit. The same
          is true for load values too.

   -t <time>
          Time in seconds allowed to finish the simulation. The default is no
          limit.

   -v <N>
          Specify verbosity level, N.
