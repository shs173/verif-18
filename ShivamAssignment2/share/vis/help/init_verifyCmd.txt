  init_verify - create and initialize a flattened network for verification
     _________________________________________________________________

   init_verify [-b] [-h]

   This command initializes the system for verification, and is equivalent to
   the command sequence flatten_hierarchy; static_order; build_partition_mdds.
   If a command returns an error condition, then the sequence is aborted. After
   init_verify has successfully executed, various commands can be invoked, like
   model_check, compute_reach, simulate, print_network_stats, and seq_verify.

   Please note that init_verify does not enable dynamic variable reordering.
   Sometimes, though, this is needed to complete building the partitions, and
   one has to initialize the verification by hand. Similarly, it may be wise to
   turn on dynamic variable reordering after init, so that further commands
   complete more easily. See the help page for dynamic_var_ordering.

   Command options:

   -b
          This option has no effect any longer.

   -d
          Enable dynamic variable ordering.

   -h
          Print the command usage.
