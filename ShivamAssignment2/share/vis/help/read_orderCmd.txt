     _________________________________________________________________

   read_order [-h] [-v] [<file>]

   This command reads variable order from a file and reorder variable order
   according to the order. This command can be used any time after static_order
   command. However, the users should notice that there is a possibility to get
   BDD blowups during this command.

   Command options:

   -h
          Print the command usage.

   -g <group>
          Specify whether to group present and next state variables or not.

          0: Do not group.

          1: Do group (default).

   -v
          Print debug information.

   <file>
          A file containing names of network nodes, used to specify a variable
          ordering. The name of a node is the full hierarchical path name,
          starting from the current hierarchical node. A node should appear at
          most once in the file. Each node name should appear at the beginning
          of a new line, with no white space preceeding it. The end of a node
          name is marked by white space, and any other text on the rest of the
          line  is  ignored. Any line starting with "#" or white space is
          ignored. See write_order for a sample file. Note that the variable
          ordering  cannot  be specified at the bit-level; it can only be
          specified at the multi-valued variable level.
