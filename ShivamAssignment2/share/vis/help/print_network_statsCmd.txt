  print_network_stats - print statistics about the flattened network
     _________________________________________________________________

   print_network_stats [-h]

   Prints the following statistics about the flattened network:

     name: the name of the flattened network

     combinational:  the  number of nodes which have a table defining the
          function of the node (excludes pseudo inputs)

     primary inputs: the number of primary input nodes of the flattened network

     primary outputs: the number of primary output nodes of the flattened
          network

     latches: the number of (multi-valued) latches

     pseudo inputs: the number of pseudo input nodes of the flattened network

     constants: the number of combinational nodes that implement a multi-valued
          constant

     edges: the number of fanouts in the network (e.g. if the output of a node
          is used in two places, this contributes two to the sum)

   Note that flatten_hierarchy must be called before this command.

   Example output:
  small  combinational=2  pi=2  po=0  latches=1  pseudo=0  const=1  edges=4
  

   Command options:

   -h
          Print the command usage.
