  source - execute commands from a file
     _________________________________________________________________

   source [-h] [-p] [-s] [-x] <file> [<args>]

   Reads and executes commands from a file.

   Command options:

   -h
          Print the command usage.

   -p
          Print a prompt before reading each command.

   -s
          Silently ignore an attempt to execute commands from a nonexistent
          file.

   -x
          Echo each command before it is executed.

   <file>
          File name

   Arguments on the command line after the filename are remembered but not
   evaluated. Commands in the script file can then refer to these arguments
   using the history substitution mechanism.

   EXAMPLE:

   Contents of test.scr:

  read_blif_mv %:2
  init_verify
  simulate -n 10
  

   Typing  "source test.scr lion.mv" on the command line will execute the
   sequence

  read_blif_mv lion.mv
  init_verify
  simulate -n 10
  

   (In  this  case  %:0  gets "source", %:1 gets "test.scr", and %:2 gets
   "lion.mv".)  If  you type "alias st source test.scr" and then type "st
   lion.blif bozo", you will execute

  read_blif_mv bozo
  init_verify
  simulate -n 10
  

   because "bozo" was the second argument on the last command line typed. In
   other words, command substitution in a script file depends on how the script
   file  was  invoked.  Switches  passed to a command are also counted as
   positional parameters. Therefore, if you type "st -x lion.mv bozo", you will
   execute
  read_blif_mv lion.mv
  init_verify
  simulate -n 10
  

   To pass the "-x" switch (or any other switch) to "source" when the script
   uses positional parameters, you can define an alias. For instance, "alias
   srcx source -x".
