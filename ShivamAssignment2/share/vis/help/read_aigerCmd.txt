  read_aiger - read an AIGER file
     _________________________________________________________________

   read_aiger [-c] [-h] [-v] <file_name>

   Reads an AIGER file into VIS. The existing hierarchy for the input file
   previously read in is overwritten upon a successful read. If an error is
   detected while reading a file, the previous hierarchy is preserved.

   Command options:

   -c
          Semi-canonicalize all the tables in each model. The canonicalization
          process, assigns a linear order to the table rows and columns, based
          on  the  value of their entries. For a table with binary valued
          entries,  this value is exactly the number of 1's in the row or
          column. Once this linear order is assigned, the rows and columns of
          the table are swapped so as to order rows and columns with higher
          value at the beginning of the corresponding row or column order. It
          is called semi-canonicalization because two tables representing the
          same logic function need not have the same canonical form.

   -h
          Print the command usage.

   -v
          If  set, the program prints out all the unused variables in the
          blif-mv  file.  Otherwise,  only a warning is printed that some
          variables are not used.

   <file_name>
          AIGER file to be read in.

   For more information on AIGER, refer to the [1]AIGER home page. This command
   uses the atandard AIGER library for parsing.
